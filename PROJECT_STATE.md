# AI ENTRY POINT

**DO NOT SCAN THE FULL REPOSITORY.**

Read `REPLIT_RULES.md` first. Use this file as the authoritative current development state. Then read only the files listed under **Relevant files for current task**.

## Project

- **Project name:** Meme Coin Hunter AI
- **Current phase:** P01 — Application Foundation
- **Current task:** P01-T05 — Application Service & Worker Extensions
- **Current task status:** DONE
- **Last updated:** 2026-08-10

## Master progress

- P00: DONE; T01 done; T02 done
- P01: T01 done; T02 done; T03 done; T04 done; T05 done
- P02–P12: Not started

## Phase status

- **Done:** P00 governance map, architecture boundaries, continuation rules, safety and testing principles; P01-T01 technical baseline and minimal runtime; P01-T02 runtime and configuration foundation; P01-T03 persistence foundation; P01-T04 application service and worker foundation; P01-T05 application service and worker extensions
- **In progress:** None
- **Blocked:** None
- **On hold:** None
- **Not started:** All later implementation phases

## Current objective

Maintain a portable, auditable application foundation with explicit service,
worker lifecycle, and fail-closed safety boundaries before implementing any
market, AI, wallet, trading, or production functionality.

## Last verified checkpoint

P01-T05 application service and worker extensions verified on 2026-08-10.
No market, AI, wallet, trading, or execution functionality was added.

## Optional files

- `lib/`
- `artifacts/`

## Do not read / out of scope

- Do not scan the full repository.
- Later implementation phases must not begin without explicit approval and review of the applicable architecture baseline.
- Do not implement Solana, DEX, wallet, AI/ML, signals, paper trading, execution, Railway, Redis, or a full dashboard before their planned phases.

## Known issues

- No known P01-T05 issues.
- P01-T05 adds only explicit worker coordination, lifecycle inspection, failure
  visibility, and fail-closed safety propagation; no external integrations,
  database migrations, trading capabilities, commit, or push were added.

## Next action

Wait for audit of the completed P01-T05 implementation.

## Next task

No later task is authorized. Await audit.

## Required secret names

No secret values are stored here. Future integrations must use environment
secrets; names will be added only when a later task requires them.

## V1.1 architecture revision

- **Status:** DONE as a documentation/governance revision
- **Baseline:** V1.1
- **Implementation authorized by this revision:** P01-T04; P01-T05 was separately approved against its specification
- **P01-T04:** DONE
- **P01-T05:** DONE
- **Next implementation action:** Await audit; do not start later tasks without explicit approval
